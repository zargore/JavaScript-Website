# JavaScript-Website
My first website

This website was created for 158258 Web development  class, assignment 1.
We had to create a javaScript tutorial website, having at least 5 html pages, 2 css pages, and 1 javascript page.
It also had to show examples of variables, data types, conditions, loops and functions.
